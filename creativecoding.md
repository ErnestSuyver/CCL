# Creative Coding

## What is creative coding?

To get an idea of the breadth and depth of creative coding - or generative art, computer art, algorithmic art, or whatever you want to call it - check out the site of the [Design in Motion Festival](https://demofestival.com/). During this 24-hour festival, in October 2022, works produced by creative coding were displayed on more than 5000 screens in train stations, shopping centers, airports, on the streets and along the highways.

## example

Have a look at this [page](examples.ipynb) to see some examples of creative code, such as this one.

<!-- I first had also this -->
<!-- :name: example-1-Turtle -->
<!-- but that resulted in TWO pictures being displayed -->

### P5

### Coding Train

The [Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com/) with Daniel Shiffman is community dedicated to learning creative coding with beginner-friendly tutorials and projects on YouTube and more.
