## Context

What is happening with creative coding in Leiden?

Beyond a [course](https://studiegids.universiteitleiden.nl/courses/114062/creative-programming) at Leiden University, not much, it seems. Obviously, this needs to change ðŸ˜„

Consider that Leiden is a city with a large and prominent university. A university with an Arts department and close collaboration with the [Royal Academy of Art](https://www.kabk.nl/).

Leiden has an expanding working population and a flowering ecosystem of  innovative organizations, start-ups and growing businesses.

Leiden is full of people with vision, drive and creativity.
