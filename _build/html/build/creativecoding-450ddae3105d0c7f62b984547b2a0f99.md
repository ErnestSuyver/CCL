# Creative Coding

To get an idea of the breadth and depth of creative coding - or generative art, computer art, algorithmic art, or whatever you want to call it - have a look at the site of the [Design in Motion Festival](https://demofestival.com/). During this 24 hour festival, in October 2022, works produced by creative coding were displayed on more than 5000 screens in train stations, shopping centers, airports, on the streets and along the motorways.

## example

This [notebook] gives an example.

## notebooks

There is currently one, with an elementary example using the Turtle library from the Python programming language.

In the future, we may add more, such as examples using the DrawBot or the Py5 libraries, both in Python.

Jupyter Notebooks also support other languages, such as JavaScript. This means we can also add examples using P5.js or D3.js.

And there are many more libraries that can be used for visualization or other artistic purposes.

## some resources

### P5

[p5.js](https://p5js.org/) is a JavaScript library for creative coding, with a focus on making coding accessible and inclusive for artists, designers, educators, beginners, and anyone else! p5.js is free and open-source because we believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone.

### Coding Train

The [Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com/) with Daniel Shiffman is community dedicated to learning creative coding with beginner-friendly tutorials and projects on YouTube and more.
