    "Turtle, or [Turtle Graphics](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html), is a Python library that lets people draw figures. It is called \"Turtle\" because the cursor is a turtle holding a pen, drawing a line as it moves. Originally, turtles were robots, literally drawing figures on paper. Later, Turtle graphics became a key feature of the educational [Logo programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language))."
