What is happening with creative coding in Leiden?

Beyond a [course](https://studiegids.universiteitleiden.nl/courses/114062/creative-programming) at Leiden University, not much it seems. Obviously, this needs to change.

## potential activities

- education (workshops, classes, videos)
- exhibitions
- assignments from universities and companies
- artist in residence
- data walks
- open office
- meetups
- colabs
- resources (examples, documentation, Q&A)
