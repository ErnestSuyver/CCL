## context

What is happening with creative coding in Leiden?

Beyond a [course](https://studiegids.universiteitleiden.nl/courses/114062/creative-programming) at Leiden University, not much, it seems. Obviously, this needs to change.

Compare this to Amsterdam, where creative coding regular meet-ups take place, or Utrecht, where _Creative Coding Utrecht_ is organizing a wide variety of activities.

Consider that Leiden is a city with a large and prominent university. A university with an Arts department and close collaboration with KAKB. 

Leiden has an expanding working population and a flowering ecosystem of  innovative organizations, start-ups and growing businesses.

Leiden is full of people, young of age and young of heart, people with vision, drive and creativity.

Leiden _needs_ creative coding.
